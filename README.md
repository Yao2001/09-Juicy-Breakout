# E09a-Scripting

This exercise is based on what we did in the 8a and 8b. We just add the score and lives into it. When the ball falls off the paddle, the lives decline, and when the ball hit the tiles, the score increase. At the beginning of this work you can click on the icon and start the game and when you clear all the tiles on the screen, the screen will show up the appear and when you lose, the game over will appear on the screen.
